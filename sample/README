README for project LILO / samples
=================================

Picture files for boot menu must be rl-coded bmp files.

Files as distributed have been edited through 'lilo -E XXXX.bmp' to specify
useful boot table layouts, colors, and timer positions. The companion *.dat
files contain photo credits, where applicable, as well as the  'lilo -E ...'
parametric information contained in the LILO-bmp headers in the actual
picture files.

Naming convention:
   64 in the name indicates '6'40 x 480 x '4' color bits (mode 0x12)
   68 in the name indicates '6'40 x 480 x '8' color bits (mode 0x101)

*64* files will display on any IBM-compatible VGA display adapter.
*68* files require a video adapter which supports VESA bios extensions;
  specifically, mode 0x101 -- 640 x 480 x 256 colors.

If you have booted with LILO, then you may easily inquire of your video
adapter's capabilities with:

  lilo -T video

The video adapter type, and the video modes supported by its BIOS, will be
displayed; i.e., those graphic modes of interest to the LILO bitmap
interface.

Example for syntax and colors
-----------------------------

  color palette: 0 black,    3 magenta, 
                 7 pink,     8 middle grey,
                10 bright grey, 13 white
 
  bmp-colors = <fg>,<bg>,<sh>,<high-fg>,<high-bg>,<high-sh>
  if <bg> or <high-bg> not defined, than it is transparent
  if <sh> or <high-sh> not defined, than it is no color
 
  bmp-table = <x>,<y>,<ncol>,<nrow>,<xsep>,<spill>
  if <ncol> = 1 then there are only one menu column
                and <spill> will not be defined
 
  bmp-timer = <x>,<y>,<fg>,<bg>,<sh>
