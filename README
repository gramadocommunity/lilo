README for project LILO
=======================

Versoin 23.0 (release) -- Joachim Wiedorn <ad_debian@joonet.de>
---------------------------------------------------------------

Option 'small-memory':

  New option to define, that kernel+initrd should always set into the
  low memory under 15M. But if this is impossible, lilo try to use the
  high memory above 16M for initrd and give you a warning.

Option 'large-memory':

  This option enables using memory above 16Mb for the initrd (up to a
  kernel imposed limit of around 768Mb) which is usable on nearly all
  newer systems with post-2000 BIOSes. Details can be found in manpage
  lilo.conf(5).

No option 'large-memory' or 'small-memory':

  If no option is set in the configuration, then lilo will check the
  needed memory space and give you some informations about the result
  and its decision in verbose mode.
  If you need the old behaviour, please use the option 'small-memory'.

Installation into a subdirectory:

  If you want to install all lilo files into a specific directory which 
  is not the root directory "/", then use the shell variable DESTDIR to
  set an absolut path for installation:

      make install DESTDIR=/home/myself/test/lilo/
  or
      make install DESTDIR=`pwd`/test/

  WARNING: You always need an absolute path! This behaviour have changed 
  since version 22.x. The old variable ROOT is obsolete for installing.

Using UUIDs for partitions:

  In the configuration file of lilo all lines with 'root=' can be used
  together with UUIDs. To extract your UUIDs let run the program blkid.
  Here an example:

      #OLD#root = /dev/hda6 = /dev/sda6
      root  = "UUID=5472fd8e-9089-4256-bcaa-ceab4f01a439"

  But then you should also use a similar expression for the 'boot=' line.
  Unfortunately you cannot use UUIDs because devices haven't any UUIDs.
  The solution is using the udev device names which can be found in 
  /dev/disks/by-id/ i. e. for a PATA disk:
  
      boot = /dev/disk/by-id/ata-SAMSUNG_SV1604N_S01FJ10X999999

  or i. e. for a SATA disk :

      boot = /dev/disk/by-id/ata-SAMSUNG_HD502HI_S1VZJ90S999999
